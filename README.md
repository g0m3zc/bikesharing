## Results:

Overall these observations were found.
81% of trips were made by subscribers of the service.
Peak hours for trips to start included 5 and 6pm.
The majority of trips were less than 20 minutes long.

## Summary:

Based on the business in New York, it is recommended that Male Subscribers are the ideal population to market to for a bikesharing business.  Future visualizations could show the travel direction of bikes, or calculating the distance from the two points.  With other datasets, we might be able to compare other city data against popular start and stop locations.  We might also be able to compare the data based on the known weather on the dates.  We could also create bins for age and create visualizations to see how different ages may have different usage of the service.
